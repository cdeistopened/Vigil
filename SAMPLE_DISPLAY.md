## Antiphons for Lauds

His disciples said unto Blessed Martin: Father, why wilt thou go away from us? or with whom wilt thou leave us orphans? For ravening wolves will break in upon thy flock.

Lord, if I be still needful to thy people, I refuse not to work. thy will be done.

Not to be told is this man's glory; whom the Lord hath made a true lover of all virtue; and a rich man, and clothed him with the raiment of salvation.

## Nocturn I - Readings on the Blessed Virgin Mary

### First Reading
*From the letter of Blessed Ambrose, bishop of Milan, to Pope Siricius*

How great is the madness of their dismal barkings, that the same persons should say that Christ could not be born of a virgin, and yet assert that women, after having given birth to human pleasure, can become virgins by the blessing of Christ! As if He Who came to take away the cause of vice could add to its occasions, or that He Who was sent to free the souls of men should corrupt their bodies! There is not one law for God and another for man. Christ did not teach one thing and do another. It is written "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above" (James i. 17). How then can the gift of virginity be from above if Mary has it not, who was the Mother of Christ?

---

### Second Reading
*From the book of St. Jerome, Priest, against Jovian*

Christ is virgin, and the mother of our virgin Christ remains forever virgin, the Virgin Mother. For Jesus entered the world, as he entered the upper room, "the doors being shut" (John xx. 19). In the very sepulchre she left her Son a virgin, as the Lord rose from the sepulchre without breaking its seal. Some people babble, asserting that Mary had other children, relying on the passage that speaks of the "brethren of the Lord." But whoever reads carefully the Scriptures knows that kinsmen, and those who are related by blood to one house, are all called brethren.

---

### Third Reading
*From the book of St. Irenaeus, Bishop and Martyr, Against Heretics*

That the Lord should come "unto His own" and that His own creation should bear Him by whom itself was born; that He should make amends through His obedience on the tree of the Cross for the disobedience which was in the tree – rightly therefore does the apostolic tradition, as taught by the Church throughout the whole world, proclaim that the Word of God is born through Mary, that He, the Son of God, became the Son of Man, so that through the Son of Man, man might pass into adoption by God, and become a son of God.

## Nocturn II - Further Readings on Our Lady

### Fourth Reading
*From the Commentary of St. Jerome, Priest, on the prophet Ezechiel*

"This gate is to remain closed; it is not to be opened." In a beautiful figure, some persons understand the closed gate which only the Lord, the God of Israel enters. The leader, on whose account it has remained permanently closed, is Christ, the Prince of the new covenant. For Mary bore the Lord, and after His birth she remained a virgin. The prophet Ezechiel foretold this mystery, saying "This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall pass through it: because the Lord the God of Israel hath entered in by it, and it shall be shut for the prince" (Ezech. xliv. 2, 3).

---

### Fifth Reading
*From the Treatise of St. Augustine, Bishop, on the Creed, to the Catechumens*

Through a woman came death; through a woman, life: through Eve, ruin; through Mary, salvation. The former, corrupted, followed the deceiver; the latter, uncorrupted, gave birth to the Saviour. The former by her sin slew the living; the latter, by her faith, restored the dead to life. Eve introduced the serpent into Paradise; Mary introduced Christ into the world. By Eve death entered in; by Mary salvation flowed forth.

## Nocturn III - The Life of St. Martin

### Sixth Reading
*From the Life of St. Martin*

Martin was born at Sabaria in Pannonia. When he was ten years old he went to the Church, in spite of his (heathen) father and mother, and by his own will was numbered among the Catechumens. At fifteen years of age he joined the army, and served as a soldier first under Constantine, and then under Julian Caesar.

He did not, however, do so willingly, for from his very earliest years the holy childhood of this godly boy yearned after the service of God rather than of the world. Nevertheless, he fulfilled his duties as a soldier while ever striving after the monastic life. At this time occurred the famous incident. When he was yet a Catechumen, and but eighteen years of age, one day in the depth of a very hard winter he met at the gate of the city of Amiens a poor man with hardly any clothes on.

As he saw that no one gave him anything, Martin understood that the man was reserved for his charity. But he had nothing except the clothes he wore, for he had already spent the rest in like good works. So he took his sword and divided his military cloak into two parts, and gave one part to the poor man and put on the rest himself.

The following night he saw Christ clothed with that part of the garment wherewith he had clad the poor man, and he heard Jesus saying to the multitude of Angels who stood around Him: "Martin, as yet but a Catechumen, hath clad Me in this garment."

### Seventh Reading

At eighteen years of age he was baptized. He gave up thereupon the life of a soldier, and betook himself to Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers, by whom he was placed in the order of Acolytes.

Being afterwards made Bishop of Tours, he built a monastery wherein he lived in holiness for a season. Here there gathered unto him eighty disciples, to be taught by his holy example. Neither gold nor silver was seen there, save only one brazen pot. Neither difference of rank nor different kinds of food were allowed there, but all did eat the same meat, and all did wear the same garments.

Martin was illustrious for deeds of mercy, constant in prayer, renowned for miracles, and especially for the gift of raising the dead. It is related of him that on three different occasions he raised to life persons who were dead.

### Eighth Reading
*The Holy Death of St. Martin*

When his disciples saw him, in the height of the fever, lying upon his back and praying, they entreated him to turn over and take a little rest upon his side while the violence of his sickness would allow him.

But Martin answered them: **"Suffer me to look heavenward rather than earthward, that my spirit may be directed toward the Lord, as it is ready to go unto Him."**

When he had said this, he saw the devil standing near him, and said unto him: "Why standest thou here, thou bloody beast? Murderer, thou shalt find nothing in me; Abraham's bosom is about to receive me."

With these words in his mouth he gave up the ghost, in the year of our Lord 397, and in the eighty-first year of his own age. He was buried at Tours, and his funeral was celebrated with an exceeding great gathering of people.

## Responsory after Eighth Reading

## Notes on St. Martin

**The Famous Cloak Story:**
As a soldier at age 18, Martin cut his military cloak in half to share with a freezing beggar. That night, Christ appeared to him wearing the half-cloak, saying: "Martin, as yet but a Catechumen, hath clad Me in this garment." This vision led to his baptism and eventual life as a monk and bishop.

**His Legacy:**
- Founded monasticism in Gaul (France)
- Bishop of Tours
- Performed miracles including raising 3 people from the dead
- Famous last words: "Suffer me to look heavenward rather than earthward"
- Died November 11, 397 AD (81 years old)
- One of the most beloved saints of medieval Europe

**Why He Matters:**
St. Martin exemplifies charity, humility, and devotion. His life shows the transformation from soldier to servant of Christ, and his death prayer shows complete trust in God's will: "Lord, if I be still needful to thy people, I refuse not to work for them. Thy will be done."
